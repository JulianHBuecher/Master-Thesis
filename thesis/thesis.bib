	abstract = {Mobile platforms cover a broad range of applications from small portable electric devices, drones, and robots to electric transportation, which influence the quality of modern life. The end-to-end energy systems of these platforms are moving toward more electrification. Despite their wide range of power ratings and diverse applications, the electrification of these systems shares several technical requirements. Electrified mobile energy systems have minimal or no access to the power grid, and thus, to achieve long operating time, ultrafast charging or charging during motion as well as advanced battery technologies are needed. Mobile platforms are space-, shape-, and weight-constrained, and therefore, their onboard energy technologies such as the power electronic converters and magnetic components must be compact and lightweight. These systems should also demonstrate improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional designs. This paper discusses some technical challenges that the industry currently faces moving toward more electrification of energy conversion systems in mobile platforms, herein referred to as E-Mobility, and reviews the recent advancements reported in literature.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the current status and implementation of battery chargers, charging power levels, and infrastructure for plug-in electric vehicles and hybrids. Charger systems are categorized into off-board and on-board types with unidirectional or bidirectional power flow. Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues. Bidirectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the electric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience), Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed. Future aspects such as roadbed charging are presented. Various power level chargers and infrastructure configurations are presented, compared, and evaluated based on amount of power, charging time and location, cost, equipment, and other factors.},

	abstract = {The charging infrastructure for electric vehicles faces the challenges of insufficient capacity and long charging duration. These challenges decrease the electric vehicle users’ satisfaction and lower the profits of infrastructure providers. Reservation systems can mitigate these issues. We introduce a reference architecture for interoperable reservation systems. The advantages of the proposed architecture are: it (1) considers the needs of the most relevant electric mobility stakeholders, (2) satisfies the interoperability requirements of existing technological heterogeneity, and (3) provides a classification of reservation types based on a morphological methodology. We instantiate the reference architecture and verify its interoperability and fulfillment of stakeholder requirements. Further, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept by instantiating and implementing an ad-hoc reservation approach. Our validation was based on simulations of real-world case studies for various reservation deployments in the Netherlands. We conclude that, in certain high demand situations, reservations can save significant time for electric vehicle trips. The findings indicate that a reservation system does not directly increase the utilization of the charging infrastructure.},

	abstract = {It has been revealed that cruising for parking is one of the main sources of road congestion and pollution, as well as daily discomfort and stress experienced by drivers while on road to attend their everyday businesses. Therefore, there is a substantial need to design efficient car parking mechanisms that can be easily deployed into future intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we tackle this important issue and we propose a new Reservation-based multi-Objective {SmArt} Parking approach denoted as {ROSAP}. Our approach uses a simulated annealing based meta-heuristic to optimize the parking slot assignment problem formulated as a multi-objective Integer Linear Program ({ILP}). {ROSAP} helps drivers to find the most suitable parking slot within their areas of interest and with respect to their specified constraints. In order to gauge the effectiveness of our proposal, we conducted extensive simulation experiments considering a real-like environment. Results show significant gains in both request satisfaction ratio and parking occupancy while keeping a minimal walking distance between the parking and the user's destination, in comparison with greedy approaches where each vehicle is assigned a free parking slot, which is closer to the destination.},

	abstract = {The description of the functionality of a smart grid’s architectural concept, analyzing different Smart Grid ({SG}) scenarios without disrupting the smooth operation of the individual processes, is a major challenge. The field of smart energy grids has been increasing in complexity since there are many stakeholder entities with diverse roles. Electric Vehicles ({EVs}) can transform the stress on the energy grid into an opportunity to act as a flexible asset. Smart charging through an external control system can have benefits for the energy sector, both in grid management and environmental terms. A suitable model for analyzing and visualizing smart grid use cases in a technology-neutral manner is required. This paper presents a flexible architecture for the potential implementation of electromobility as a distributed storage asset for the grid’s capacity optimization by applying the Use Case and Smart Grid Architecture Model ({SGAM}) methodologies. The use case scenario of booking a charge session through a mobile application, as part of the {TwinERGY} Horizon 2020 project, is deployed to structure the {SGAM} framework layers and investigate the applicability of the {SGAM} framework in the integration of electromobility as a distributed storage asset into electricity grids with the objective of enhanced flexibility and decarbonization.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the optimal dynamic scheduling of electric vehicles ({EVs}) in a parking lot ({PL}) is proposed to minimize the charging cost. In static scheduling, the {PL} operator can make the optimal scheduling if the demand, arrival, and departure time of {EVs} are known well in advance. If not, a static charging scheme is not feasible. Therefore, dynamic charging is preferred. A dynamic scheduling scheme means the {EVs} may come and go at any time, i.e., {EVs}’ arrival is dynamic in nature. The {EVs} may come to the {PL} with prior appointments or not. Therefore, a {PL} operator requires a mechanism to charge the {EVs} that arrive with or without reservation, and the demand for {EVs} is unknown to the {PL} operator. In general, the {PL} uses the first-in-first serve ({FIFS}) method for charging the {EVs}. The well-known optimization techniques such as particle swarm optimization and shuffled frog leaping algorithms are used for the {EVs}’ dynamic scheduling scheme to minimize the grid’s charging cost. Moreover, a microgrid is also considered to reduce the charging cost further. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the proposed solution methods.},

However, several factors are currently impeding this process, ranging from insufficient charging infrastructure, battery capacity, and long queueing and charging times, to psychological factors. On top of range anxiety, the frustration of the {EV} drivers is further fuelled by the uncertainty of finding an available charging point on their route. To address this issue, we propose a solution that bypasses the limitations of the “reserve now” function of the {OCPP} standard, enabling drivers to make charging reservations for the upcoming days, especially when planning a longer trip. We created an algorithm that generates reservation intervals based on the charging station’s reservation and transaction history. Subsequently, we ran a series of test cases that yielded promising results, with no overlapping reservations and the occupation of several stations without queues, assuring, thus, a proper distribution of the available energy resources, while increasing end-user satisfaction. Our solution is independent from the {OCPP} reservation method; therefore, the authentication and reservation processes performed by the proposed algorithm run only through the central system, authorizing only the creator of the reservation to start the charging transaction.},

	abstract = {Since technology of electro mobility is rapidly getting mature and attracts attention of consumers year after year, the management of charging demand and processes has more and more relevance. Nowadays, companies already test novel charging technologies with advanced information services. Therefore, the research question was how to decrease idle time on the charging points and make it predictable as well as to increase capacity utilization of charging facilities. In this paper, we elaborated a new method of automatic reservation process requiring notification of the user. The method uses real-time information about the vehicle status and position. We simulated the application of the method, and the results are presented in detail. This new information service based on the method can be applied in smart cities and along the highways too.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles ({EVs}) still have relatively long and frequent charging cycles. Moreover, charging resources are typically limited and must therefore be used efﬁciently. The V-Charge project has the vision to provide a solution by combining autonomous valet parking with e-mobility, introducing improved parking and charging comfort. V-Charge proposes a solution for charging autonomous {EVs} in parking places and efﬁciently using scarce charging resources, thus simplifying the life of the customer and increasing the feasibility of {EVs}. For the management of parking lots and charging resources, V-Charge provides a server back end and a communication infrastructure. In this paper, we present our design of scheduling concepts for a coordinated charging strategy that is implemented by this back end. Through intensive simulations, we show that the V-Charge server is able to efﬁciently handle realistic parking volume and performs well in fulﬁlling customer requirements, e.g., energy demand for the next driving tasks. Moreover, we evaluate the suitability of various scheduling strategies in different usage scenarios. For the simulation setup, real-world parking statistics obtained from Hamburg Airport and the City of Braunschweig, Germany, are used.},

	abstract = {This article aims to design an intelligent mobile charging control mechanism for electric vehicles ({EVs}), by promoting charging reservations (including service start time, expected charging time, and charging location). {EV} mobile charging could be implemented as an alternative recharging solution, wherein charge replenishment is provided by economically mobile plug-in chargers, capable of providing on-site charging services. With intelligent charging management, readily available mobile chargers are predictable and could be efﬁciently scheduled toward {EVs} with charging demand, based on updated context collected from across the charging network. The context can include critical information relating to charging sessions and charging demand. Furthermore, with reservations introduced, accurate estimations on charging demand for a future moment are achievable, and correspondingly, optimal mobile chargers selection can be obtained. Therefore, charging demands across the network can be efﬁciently and effectively satisﬁed, with the support of intelligent system-level decisions. In order to evaluate critical performance attributes, we further carry out extensive simulation experiments with practical concerns to verify our insights observed from the theoretical analysis. Results show great performance gains by promoting the reservation-based mobile charger selection, especially for mobile chargers equipped with sufﬁce power capacity.},
