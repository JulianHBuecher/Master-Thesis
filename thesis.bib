	abstract = {The principle of least privilege in role-based access control is an important area of research. There are two crucial issues related to it: the specification and the enforcement. We believe that the existing least privilege specification schemes are not comprehensive enough and few of the enforcement methods are likely to scale well. In this paper, we formally define the basic principle of least privilege problem and present different variations, called the delta-approx principle of least privilege problem and the minimizing-approx principle of least privilege problem. Since there may be more than one result to enforce the same principle of least privilege, we introduce the notation about weights of permissions and roles to optimize the results. Then we prove that all least privilege problems are {NP}-complete. As an important contribution of the paper, we show that the principle of least privilege problem can be reduced to minimal cost set covering ({MCSC}) problem. We can borrow the existing solutions of {MCSC} to solve the principle of least privilege problems. Finally, different algorithms are designed to solve the proposed least privilege problems. Experiments on performance study prove the superiority of our algorithms. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Several researchers have pioneered {DS} research in {IS}, yet over the past 15 years, little {DS} research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for {DS} research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology ({DSRM}) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing {DS} research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating {DS} research in {IS}. The {DS} process includes six steps: problem identiﬁcation and motivation, deﬁnition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the {DSRM}, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an {IS} planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisﬁes the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of {DS} research in the {IS} discipline.},

In order to manage {EV} charging, the parking lot local controller ({PLLC}) requires data exchange with {EV} charging stations ({EVCSs}) through communication infrastructures. However, data losses and communication delays are unavoidable and may significantly degrade the system performance. This work aims to investigate the underlying communication networks for remote monitoring of {EVCSs} in a smart campus parking lot. The communication network consists of two subnetworks: parking area network ({PAN}) and campus area network ({CAN}). {PAN} covers communication among {EVs}, charging stations and {PLLC}, while {CAN} enables dedicated communication between {PLLCs} and a global controller of the university. As one of the major obstacles in {EV} system is the lack of unified communication architecture to integrate {EVCS} in the power grid, we develope communication models for the in-vehicle system and {EVCSs} based on logical node concept of {IEC} 61850 standard. Furthermore, we implement network models for {EVCSs} using {OPNET} modeler. Different communication technologies and configurations are considered in modeling and simulations, and end-to-end delay is evaluated and discussed.},

Unlike fuel stations, charging station solutions are to be developed separately to suit different user groups.

In this setting, users are allowed to explicitly express their preferences over different start times and the length of charging periods for charging their vehicles. The goal is to compute optimal charging schedules that maximize the social welfare of all users given their time preferences and the state of charge of their vehicles. Assuming that users are self-interested agents who may behave strategically to advance their own benefits rather than the social welfare of all agents, we propose an iterative auction, which computes high-quality schedules and, at the same time, preserves users' privacy by progressively eliciting their preferences as necessary. We conduct a game theoretical analysis on the proposed iterative auction to prove its individual rationality and the best response for agents. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the iterative auction can achieve high-efficiency solutions with a partial value information. Additionally, we explore the relationship between scheduling efficiency and information revelation in the auction.},

Here, when and where to recharge are sensitive factors signiﬁcantly impacting the environmental and ﬁnancial gains, these are still challenges to be tackled. In this paper, we propose a sustainable and smart {EV} charging scheme enables the preemptive charging functions for heterogeneous {EVs} equipped with various charging capabilities and brands. Our scheme intents to address the problems when {EVs} are with various ownerships and priority, in related to the services agreed with charging infrastructure operators. Particularly, the anticipated {EVs}’ charging reservations information with heterogeneity (are multiscale) including their {EV} type, expected arrival time and charging waiting time at the charging stations ({CSs}), have been considered for design, planning and optimal decision making on the selection (i.e., where to charge) among the candidature {CSs}. We have conducted extensive simulation studies, by taking the realistic Helsinki city geographical and trafﬁc scenarios as an example. The numerical results have conﬁrmed that our proposed preemptive approach is better than the First-Come-First-Serve ({FCFS}) based system, associated with its signiﬁcant improvement on the reservation feature in {EV} charging.},

	abstract = {Motivated by alleviating {CO}2 pollution, electric vehicle ({EV})-based applications have recently received wide interests from both commercial and research communities by using electric energy instead of traditional fuel energy. Although {EVs} are inherently with limited traveling distance, such limitation could be overcome by deploying public charging stations ({CSs}) to recharge {EVs}' battery during their journeys. In this paper we propose a novel communication framework for on-the-move {EV} charging scenario, based on the Publish/Subscribe (P/S) mechanism for disseminating necessary {CS} information to {EVs}, in order for them to make optimized decisions on where to charge. A core part of our communication framework is the utilization of roadside units ({RSUs}) to bridge the information flow from {CSs} to {EVs}, which has been regarded as a type of cost-efficient communication infrastructure. Under this design, we introduce two complementary communication modes of signal protocols, namely, push and pull modes, in order to enable the required information dissemination operation. Both analysis and simulation show the advantage of the pull mode, in which the information is cached at {RSUs} to support asynchronous communication. We further propose a remote reservation service based on the pull mode such that the {CS}-selection decision making can utilize the knowledge of {EVs}' charging reservation, as published from {EVs} through {RSUs} to {CSs}. Results show that both performances at {CS} and {EV} sides are further improved based on using this anticipated information.},

One of the inﬂuencing factors of electric vehicles large-scale application is the availability of charging stations and convenience of charging. It is important to investigate how to make reserving charging strategies and ensure electric vehicles are charged with shorter time and lower charging expense whenever charging request is proposed. This paper proposes a reserving charging decision-making model for electric vehicles that move to certain destinations and need charging services in consideration of trafﬁc conditions and available charging resources at the charging stations. Besides, the interactive mechanism is described to show how the reserving charging system works, as well as the rolling records-based credit mechanism where extra charges from {EV} is considered to hedge default behavior. With the objectives of minimizing driving time and minimizing charging expenses, an optimization model with two objective functions is formulated. Then the optimizations are solved by a K shortest paths algorithm based on a weighted directed graph, where the time and distance factors are respectively treated as weights of corresponding edges of transportation networks. Case studies show the effectiveness and validity of the proposed route plan and reserving charging decision-making model.},

	abstract = {With the growing popularization of Electric Vehicles ({EVs}), charging management has become an increasingly important research problem in smart cities. Different from plug-in charging technology, we alternatively enable the battery switch technology to provide fast {EV} charging (reduce the service waiting time from tens of minutes to a few minutes), by facilitating the switchable (fully-recharged) batteries maintained at {CSs} and also the batteries cycling procure to refresh their availability. Nevertheless, potential hot spot may still happen at {CSs}, due to running out of switchable batteries as well as long batteries charging queue. With this concern, we next propose a reservation based {EV} charging management scheme to alleviate such situation, considering {EVs}' anticipated charging reservations (including arrival time, expected charging time) to coordinate {EVs}' charging plans. Results under the Helsinki city scenario with realistic {EV} and {CS} characteristics show the advantage of our enabling technology, in terms of minimized waiting time for the battery switch as the benefit of {EV} drivers, and higher number of batteries switched as the benefit of {CSs}.},

	abstract = {Electro-mobility has become an increasingly important research problem in urban cities. Due to the limited electricity of battery, electric vehicle ({EV}) drivers may experience discomfort for long charging waiting time. Different from plug-in charging technology, we investigate the battery switch technology to improve {EV} drivers' comfort (e.g., reduce the service waiting time from tens of minutes to a few minutes), by benefiting from switchable (fully recharged) batteries cycled at charging stations ({CSs}). Since demand hotspot may still happen at {CSs} (e.g., running out of switchable batteries), incoming {EVs} may need to wait for additional time to get their battery switched, and thus, the {EV} drivers' comfort is degraded. First, we propose a centralized reservation-enabling service, considering {EVs}' reservations (including arrival time, expected charging time of their batteries to be depleted) to optimally coordinate their battery switch plans. Second, a decentralized system is further proposed, by facilitating the vehicle-to-vehicle anycasting to deliver {EV}'s reservations. This helps to address some of the privacy issues that can be materialized in a centralized system and reduce communication cost (e.g., through cellular network for reservation making). Results under the Helsinki city scenario show a tradeoff between comparable performance (e.g., service waiting time, number of switched batteries) and cellular network cost for {EVs}' reservations delivery.},

Following an intensive review on advanced smart metering and communication infrastructures, the strategy for integrating the {EVs} into the electric grid is presented. Various {EV} smart charging technologies are also extensively examined with the perspective of their potential, impacts and limitations under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) phenomenon. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind and photovoltaic solar) is soaring up into the power system. However, their intermittent power output poses different challenges on the planning, operation and control of the power system networks. On the other hand, the deployment of {EVs} in the energy market can compensate for the ﬂuctuations of the electric grid. In this context, a literature review on the integration of the renewable energy and the latest feasible solution using {EVs} with the insight of the promising research gap to be covered up are investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of the smart V2G system is thoroughly discussed.

This roll out, however, poses challenges to power systems, as additional power demand is injected in context of increasingly volatile supply from renewable energy sources. Smart {EV} charging services can provide a solution to such challenges. The development of effective smart charging services requires evaluating pre-emptively {EV} drivers’ response. The current practice in the appraisal of smart charging strategies largely relies on simplistic or theoretical representation of drivers’ charging and travel behaviour. We propose a random utility model for joint {EV} drivers’ activity-travel scheduling and charging choices. Our model easily integrates in activity-based demand modelling systems for the analyses of integrated transport and energy systems. However, unlike previous charging behaviour models used in integrated transport and energy system analyses, our model empirically captures the behavioural nuances of tactical charging choices in smart grid context, using empirically estimated charging preferences. We present model estimation results that provide insights into the value placed by individuals on the main attributes of the charging choice and draw implications charging service providers.},

	abstract = {Large scale adoption and public acceptance of Electric Vehicles ({EVs}) require availability of charging stations. Electrification of transport has been identified as the one of the significant factors that would increase the power demand. Management of charger load has become a matter of concern for the power system engineers. Uncoordinated charging can be detrimental to the smooth operation of the power grid. On the contrary, smart charging gives certain amount of control over the charging process with respect to the power grid. Hence, adaptivity of the charging process of {EVs} in smart charging assists to meet the needs of power system as well as {EV} users. A smart charger can adjust the charging power according to the power available from the grid, {EV} user needs, and also support the grid during emergency. Smart charging enables {EVs} to act as flexible grid resources thereby providing ancillary services to the grid in case of emergency. Further, {EV} users can gain significant financial benefits through smart timing of their charging against spot market prices. This work presents a comprehensive overview of smart charging thereby explaining its perception, impact, user acceptance, global status and pilot projects. Also, case studies highlighting the benefits of smart charging are presented. This detailed elucidation of smart charging will assist the researchers, and experts of power industry as well as transport to find research initiatives on smart charging at one platform thereby promoting adoption of smart charging.},

High-level {EVs} integration into the electricity grid will introduce many challenges for the power grid planning, operation, stability, standards, and safety. Therefore, the wide-scale adoption of {EVs} imposes research and development of charging systems and {EV} supply equipment ({EVSE}) to achieve expected charging solutions for {EV} batteries as well as to improve ancillary services. Analysis of the status of {EV} charging technologies is important to accelerate {EV} adoption with advanced control strategies to discover a remedial solution for negative impacts and to enhance desired charging efficiency and grid support. This paper presents a comprehensive review of {EV} charging technologies, international standards, the architecture of {EV} charging stations, and the power converter configurations of {EV} charging systems. The charging systems require a dedicated converter topology, a control strategy, compatibility with standards, and grid codes for charging and discharging to ensure optimum operation and enhance grid support. An overview of different charging systems in terms of onboard and off-board chargers, {AC}-{DC} and {DC}-{DC} converter configuration, and {AC} and {DC}-based charging station architectures are evaluated. In addition, recent charging systems which are integrated with renewable energy sources are presented to identify the power train of modern charging stations.

The lack of system standardization may hamper the {EV} uptake as well as successful utility grid integration with the charging stations. The distributed energy resources ({DER}) and vehicle to grid (V2G) are going to play a vital role in the power system operation and control. The applicability of criterions within the utility grid integration with charging station area is important to the grid operators, charging service providers, manufacturers, fleet operators, and so forth to ensure safety, dependability, and interoperability. Hence, this work tries to deliver a comprehensive and systematic review of standards and best practices for utility grid interaction with charging stations.

While comparing traditional utility grid-based {EV} charging, photovoltaic ({PV}) powered {EV} charging may signiﬁcantly lessen carbon footprints. However, there are not enough charging stations, which limits the global adoption of {EVs}. More public places are adding {EV} charging stations as {EV} use increases. However, using the current utility grid, which is powered by the fossil fuel basing generating system, to charge {EVs} has an impact on the distribution system and could not be ecologically beneﬁcial.

Finally, the challenges and suggestions for future expansion of the infrastructure of {EV} charging, grid integration, are evaluated and summarized.

This paper tries to ﬁll this gap by analyzing current charging behavior from a large charging data set from Sweden and Norway and take the ﬁndings to calibrate a queuing model for future fast charging infrastructure needs. We ﬁnd that the ratio of battery electric vehicles to public fast charging points can be similar to other alternative fuels in the future (close to one fast charging point per 1000 vehicles for high power rates of 150 {kW}). In addition, the surplus on the electricity prices for payoﬀ is only 0.05–0.15 €/{kWh} per charging point. However, charging infrastructure needs highly depend on battery sizes and power rates that are both likely to increase in the future.},

At present, smart elements are making their way into traditional electricity grid systems at every level, from transmission down to distribution. The vast size of the power grid makes the extension of digitally enabled electric infrastructure a question of cost. Drivers for this development are the growing security requirements and sustainability of supply in the face of rising demand and aging infrastructure. Information technology ({IT}) is one of the key elements of smart grids because it enables cooperation of distributed energy resources, local control, and globalized energy markets. Smart grids are expected to make our power system more resilient, “green,” and efficient; a challenge that the automotive industry could only manage by introducing digital controls in engines.

	abstract = {The large-scale implementation of renewable energy systems necessitates the development of energy storage solutions to effectively manage imbalances between energy supply and demand. Herein, we investigate such a scalable material solution for energy storage in supercapacitors constructed from readily available material precursors that can be locally sourced from virtually anywhere on the planet, namely cement, water, and carbon black. We characterize our carbon-cement electrodes by combining correlative {EDS}–Raman spectroscopy with capacitance measurements derived from cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments using integer and fractional derivatives to correct for rate and current intensity effects. Texture analysis reveals that the hydration reactions of cement in the presence of carbon generate a fractal-like electron-conducting carbon network that permeates the load-bearing cement-based matrix. The energy storage capacity of this space-filling carbon black network of the high specific surface area accessible to charge storage is shown to be an intensive quantity, whereas the high-rate capability of the carbon-cement electrodes exhibits self-similarity due to the hydration porosity available for charge transport. This intensive and self-similar nature of energy storage and rate capability represents an opportunity for mass scaling from electrode to structural scales. The availability, versatility, and scalability of these carbon-cement supercapacitors opens a horizon for the design of multifunctional structures that leverage high energy storage capacity, high-rate charge/discharge capabilities, and structural strength for sustainable residential and industrial applications ranging from energy autarkic shelters and self-charging roads for electric vehicles, to intermittent energy storage for wind turbines and tidal power stations.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of the present research was to increase understanding of the phenomenon of range anxiety and to determine the degree to which practical experience with battery electric vehicles ({BEVs}) reduces different levels of range anxiety.
Background: Limited range is a challenge for {BEV} users. A frequently discussed phenomenon in this context is range anxiety. There is some evidence suggesting that range anxiety might be a problem only for inexperienced {BEV} drivers and, therefore, might decrease with practical experience.
Method: We compared 12 motorists with high {BEV} driving experience (M = 60,500 km) with 12 motorists who had never driven a {BEV} before. The test drive was designed to lead to a critical range situation (remaining range {\textless} trip length). We examined range appraisal and range stress (i.e., range anxiety) on different levels (cognitive, emotional, and behavioral).
Results: Experienced {BEV} drivers exhibited less negative range appraisal and range anxiety than inexperienced {BEV} drivers, revealing significant, strong effects for all but one variable.
Conclusion: Hence, {BEV} driving experience (defined as absolute kilometers driven with a {BEV}) seems to be one important variable that predicts less range anxiety.
Application: In order to reduce range anxiety in {BEV} drivers even when there is a critical range situation, it is important to increase efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process.},

	abstract = {The hotel industry is a business venture for the owner and a solace for the traveler and/or tourist. A customer can get stranded in the quest to secure a hotel room to pass the night if he has not made adequate plans by the existing system. Through this study, it was realized that for a customer to be guaranteed a room, he or she has to physically come to the hotel since the attendants paid more attention to that. He could also send a friend or relative who lives around the neighbourhood of the hotel to do the booking for him. There is nothing to bond the hotel and the customer in person that he has indeed booked for a room. This study took Hansonic Hotel as its case. It looked at creating an online reservation system to enable customers choose the room they wanted after a virtual tour to guarantee him a room.},

With intelligent charging management, readily available mobile chargers are predictable and could be efﬁciently scheduled toward {EVs} with charging demand, based on updated context collected from across the charging network. The context can include critical information relating to charging sessions and charging demand. Furthermore, with reservations introduced, accurate estimations on charging demand for a future moment are achievable, and correspondingly, optimal mobile chargers selection can be obtained. Therefore, charging demands across the network can be efﬁciently and effectively satisﬁed, with the support of intelligent system-level decisions. In order to evaluate critical performance attributes, we further carry out extensive simulation experiments with practical concerns to verify our insights observed from the theoretical analysis. Results show great performance gains by promoting the reservation-based mobile charger selection, especially for mobile chargers equipped with sufﬁce power capacity.},

The V-Charge project has the vision to provide a solution by combining autonomous valet parking with e-mobility, introducing improved parking and charging comfort. V-Charge proposes a solution for charging autonomous {EVs} in parking places and efﬁciently using scarce charging resources, thus simplifying the life of the customer and increasing the feasibility of {EVs}. For the management of parking lots and charging resources, V-Charge provides a server back end and a communication infrastructure. In this paper, we present our design of scheduling concepts for a coordinated charging strategy that is implemented by this back end. Through intensive simulations, we show that the V-Charge server is able to efﬁciently handle realistic parking volume and performs well in fulﬁlling customer requirements, e.g., energy demand for the next driving tasks. Moreover, we evaluate the suitability of various scheduling strategies in different usage scenarios. For the simulation setup, real-world parking statistics obtained from Hamburg Airport and the City of Braunschweig, Germany, are used.},

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of electromobility constitutes one of the measures designed to reduce air pollution caused by traditional fossil fuels. However, several factors are currently impeding this process, ranging from insufficient charging infrastructure, battery capacity, and long queueing and charging times, to psychological factors. On top of range anxiety, the frustration of the {EV} drivers is further fuelled by the uncertainty of finding an available charging point on their route. To address this issue, we propose a solution that bypasses the limitations of the “reserve now” function of the {OCPP} standard, enabling drivers to make charging reservations for the upcoming days, especially when planning a longer trip. We created an algorithm that generates reservation intervals based on the charging station’s reservation and transaction history. Subsequently, we ran a series of test cases that yielded promising results, with no overlapping reservations and the occupation of several stations without queues, assuring, thus, a proper distribution of the available energy resources, while increasing end-user satisfaction. Our solution is independent from the {OCPP} reservation method; therefore, the authentication and reservation processes performed by the proposed algorithm run only through the central system, authorizing only the creator of the reservation to start the charging transaction.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the optimal dynamic scheduling of electric vehicles ({EVs}) in a parking lot ({PL}) is proposed to minimize the charging cost. In static scheduling, the {PL} operator can make the optimal scheduling if the demand, arrival, and departure time of {EVs} are known well in advance. If not, a static charging scheme is not feasible. Therefore, dynamic charging is preferred. A dynamic scheduling scheme means the {EVs} may come and go at any time, i.e., {EVs}’ arrival is dynamic in nature. The {EVs} may come to the {PL} with prior appointments or not. Therefore, a {PL} operator requires a mechanism to charge the {EVs} that arrive with or without reservation, and the demand for {EVs} is unknown to the {PL} operator. In general, the {PL} uses the first-in-first serve ({FIFS}) method for charging the {EVs}. The well-known optimization techniques such as particle swarm optimization and shuffled frog leaping algorithms are used for the {EVs}’ dynamic scheduling scheme to minimize the grid’s charging cost. Moreover, a microgrid is also considered to reduce the charging cost further. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the proposed solution methods.},

The field of smart energy grids has been increasing in complexity since there are many stakeholder entities with diverse roles. Electric Vehicles ({EVs}) can transform the stress on the energy grid into an opportunity to act as a flexible asset. Smart charging through an external control system can have benefits for the energy sector, both in grid management and environmental terms. A suitable model for analyzing and visualizing smart grid use cases in a technology-neutral manner is required.

The use case scenario of booking a charge session through a mobile application, as part of the {TwinERGY} Horizon 2020 project, is deployed to structure the {SGAM} framework layers and investigate the applicability of the {SGAM} framework in the integration of electromobility as a distributed storage asset into electricity grids with the objective of enhanced flexibility and decarbonization.},

These challenges decrease the electric vehicle users’ satisfaction and lower the profits of infrastructure providers. Reservation systems can mitigate these issues. We introduce a reference architecture for interoperable reservation systems. The advantages of the proposed architecture are: it (1) considers the needs of the most relevant electric mobility stakeholders, (2) satisfies the interoperability requirements of existing technological heterogeneity, and (3) provides a classification of reservation types based on a morphological methodology. We instantiate the reference architecture and verify its interoperability and fulfillment of stakeholder requirements. Further, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept by instantiating and implementing an ad-hoc reservation approach. Our validation was based on simulations of real-world case studies for various reservation deployments in the Netherlands. We conclude that, in certain high demand situations, reservations can save significant time for electric vehicle trips.

Charger systems are categorized into off-board and on-board types with unidirectional or bidirectional power flow. Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues. Bidirectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the electric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience), Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed. Future aspects such as roadbed charging are presented. Various power level chargers and infrastructure configurations are presented, compared, and evaluated based on amount of power, charging time and location, cost, equipment, and other factors.},

	abstract = {Mobile platforms cover a broad range of applications from small portable electric devices, drones, and robots to electric transportation, which influence the quality of modern life. The end-to-end energy systems of these platforms are moving toward more electrification. Despite their wide range of power ratings and diverse applications, the electrification of these systems shares several technical requirements. Electrified mobile energy systems have minimal or no access to the power grid, and thus, to achieve long operating time, ultrafast charging or charging during motion as well as advanced battery technologies are needed. Mobile platforms are space-, shape-, and weight-constrained, and therefore, their onboard energy technologies such as the power electronic converters and magnetic components must be compact and lightweight. These systems should also demonstrate improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional designs. This paper discusses some technical challenges that the industry currently faces moving toward more electrification of energy conversion systems in mobile platforms, herein referred to as E-Mobility, and reviews the recent advancements reported in literature.},
